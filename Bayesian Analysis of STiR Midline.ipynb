    "# A Crash Course on Bayesian Analysis using Python and PyMC3\n",
    "This post gives a (very) rough crash course on how to do Bayesian analysis using Python and PyMC3.  \n",

    "## Why Bayesian Analysis?\n",
    "- Typical impact evaluations seek to estimate whether an intervention, overall, had a positive effect\n",
    "- We often seek to tell clients which treatment \"flavor\" of multiple possible flavors is the one they should pursue\n",
    "- The statistical framework that we (and nearly everyone else) uses to analyse data is not great at answering this question\n",
    "- This is because frequentist stats is always based on null hypothesis testing.  \n",
    "- With 5 different treatment arms, we could come up with a lot of different hypotheses: \n",
    "    - all the arms are equal\n",
    "    - arm A has more of an impact than arm B\n",
    "    - arm A has more of an impact than the average of the other arms combined\n",
    "    - ad nauseum\n",
    "- by this point, the client is likely to be getting annoyed.  they want to know that the probability that A is the best, the probability that B is the best, etc\n",
    "- Bayesian stats offers a potential solution\n",
    "- Bayesian stats can likely help out in a lot of other ways as well.  Will talk about these more in future blog posts hopefully\n",
    "    - incorporate the client's beliefs (this could be a feature or a bug depending on your perspective)\n",
    "    - model for external validity\n",
    "    - if you accumulate units into your randomized evaluation over time (e.g. -- you randomize one class of students in the first year, a second class of students in the second year, etc) you can \n",
    "    - if your outcome variable is a latent variable, you can use something like IRT and build it right into the model (need to elaborate on what I mean by this)\n",
    "- downsides\n",
    "    - you *need* to incorporate client's beliefs (or someone's beliefs)\n",
    "    - fitting a model is much harder than just running \"regress y treat, cluster(j)\".  \n",
